# CS465 Travlr
## Module 1 Branch

This branch contains the setup and initial configuration of the Travlr web application for CS465. In Module 1, we focused on creating the basic structure of the site using the Express framework and organizing static assets. Key tasks included:

- Installing and configuring Node.js and Express.
- Setting up the initial Express application with a Handlebars (HBS) view engine.
- Organizing static files, including HTML, CSS, and images, within the `public` directory.
- Running the server and ensuring that the web application renders correctly at `http://localhost:3000`.

This branch serves as the foundation for further development in subsequent modules.
