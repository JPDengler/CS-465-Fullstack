# CS-465 Fullstack - Module 6: Full-Stack Integration with Add/Edit Functionality

This branch includes the completed work for Module 6, focusing on integrating full-stack functionality into the **Travlr Getaways** application. New features include adding trips, editing existing trips, and connecting the Angular front-end to the Express/MongoDB backend via a RESTful API.

---
## Features Implemented

1. **Add Trip Functionality**
   - Created a new Angular `add-trip` component.
   - Implemented a form for adding new trips with fields for:
     - Code
     - Name
     - Length
     - Start date
     - Resort
     - Per person price
     - Image name
     - Description
   - Connected the form to the backend `POST /api/trips` API endpoint via the `TripDataService`.

2. **Edit Trip Functionality**
   - Added an `edit-trip` component in Angular to edit existing trips.
   - Prepopulated the form with existing trip data by fetching it using the `GET /api/trips/:tripCode` endpoint.
   - Updated the trip using the `PUT /api/trips/:tripCode` API endpoint.

3. **Trip Card Updates**
   - Modified the `trip-card` component to include an "Edit Trip" button.
   - Clicking the button routes to the `edit-trip` component with the specific trip code stored in local storage.

4. **Backend Enhancements**
   - Added a `tripsUpdateTrip` method in `app_api/controllers/trips.js` to handle updating trips.
   - Updated routes in `app_api/routes/index.js` to include the `PUT` endpoint for updating trips.
   - Configured CORS in `app.js` to allow `PUT` HTTP methods.

5. **Improved Routing**
   - Updated `app.routes.ts` to include routes for the `add-trip` and `edit-trip` components.

6. **Enhanced Trip Listing**
   - Updated the `trip-listing` component to dynamically fetch trips from the backend and display them in a card format.
   - Included detailed trip information such as resort name, price, and duration.
